Welcome to Degrees of Spotify

This project takes in two artists as inputs, and by either using depth first search or breadth first search, it will return a path between the two artists through artists that they have have features in common with.

BFS will return the shortest path
Because of the nature of DFS, to find the shortest path, it would need to explore every route to find the shortest one, and with the size of the Spotify Database, that's not really possible in our scope
